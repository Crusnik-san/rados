RadOs is a free RTOS for embedded systems, released under the
flexible, open source BSD license and is free to use for commercial or
educational purposes without restriction.

It is targeted at systems that need only a lightweight scheduler and the
usual RTOS primitives. No file system, IP stack or device drivers are
included, but developers can bolt on their own as required. RadOs
will always be a small number of C files which are easy to port to any
platforms that require threading by adding a simple
architecture-specific file.
