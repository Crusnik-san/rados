"It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, 
but when there is nothing more to remove." - Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry

RadOs is a free RTOS for embedded systems focused on minimalism.
It is released under the flexible, open source BSD license and is free to use 
for commercial or educational purposes without restriction.

It is targeted for systems which need only a lightweight scheduler and the most
typical RTOS primitives. No file system, IP stack or device drivers are
included, but developers can bolt their own when required. RadOs will always be
a small number of C files which are easy to port to any platform. It is designed
in way which allows to limit the porting work to development of small
architecture-specific files.
