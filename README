RadOs is a free RTOS for embedded systems, released under the flexible, open
source BSD license and is free to use for commercial or educational purposes
without restriction.

It is targeted for systems which need only a lightweight scheduler and the most
typical RTOS primitives. No file system, IP stack or device drivers are
included, but developers can bolt their own when required. RadOs will always be
a small number of C files which are easy to port to any platform. It is designed
in way which allows to limit the porting work to development of small
architecture-specific files.
